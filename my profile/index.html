     <h2>Passions</h2>
    	<p>
  		I love sport in general. I've practised football for 9 years which gave it a special place in my heart. Barcelona is my favorit team and so for me Messi is the greatest to ever play football. I've also shared the love of Formula 1 with my father, sharing memorable moments watching Gran Prix hoping that one day Charles Leclerc will be world champion.

     <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
   	 Cooking is one of my hobbies.I'm a big fan of Italian cuisine, it's a mix of simple dish that you can cook quite easily but when it's well made tastes the best. Obviously there is French cuisine that is off the chart. I'll say that entrec√¥te whit mushrooms is one of my favourite dish to make.

     <h4>Projects</h4>
      <p>
    	I'm not sure of the job I want in the futur neither the exact studies I will make to go there. But as I love travelling and that I've been studiing english from a young age I would like to travel with my job and to have a some freedom in my projects. I'm thinking of beeing an entreprenuer.
